# SGCommute ðŸš•ðŸšŒðŸš‡

## Introduction

### What is SGCommute

SGCommute is a **REST API wrapper** for **Singapore Land Transport Authority (Singapore)'s DataMall APIs**. Compatible with all programming languages, it allows simpler and more straightforward access to LTA DataMall's data via HTTP requests.

### What data can SGCommute give me

SGCommute is able to retrieve the following data from LTA DataMall's API

- Regarding buses
  - Bus details
    - Operating company
    - AM/PM peak hours
    - Loop/bi-directional service
    - Location at which the bus service loops (if it is a looped service)
  - Bus routes
    - All bus stops covered by the bus service
    - Weekday/Saturday/Sunday first/last bus service timing at specific bus stop
- Regarding bus stops
  - Road name
  - Landmarks near bus stops to aid in identifying bus stop (if any)
  - Coordinates of bus stop (longitude and latitude)
  - Bus arrival timings at that bus stop
